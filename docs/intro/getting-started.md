#### How do I get an overview of the project?

* You can find a "non-tech" intro to the project [here](http://mettacenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Peace-Paradigm-Radio-Aug-22-2014.mp3) (the interview starts 7:10 into the broadcast)
* Go to [our wiki's Home page](https://github.com/EmpathyApp/EmpathyApp/wiki)
* Read the [advertisement](../misc/advertisement-for-devs.md) for new people
* Follow [this guide](../ways-of-working/howto/setting-up-a-remote-dev-env.md) to set up a remote development environment
* Go through this [Interactive intro](interactive-intro.md)
* A tech-oriented introduction can be found in the [readme file](../../README.md)
* For more details, please see the [Requirements specification](../planning/requirements-spec.md)


#### What can I do to make helping out easier?

* Create a checklist todo task *for personal todos*
  * Assign it to yourself 
  * Close it (if you like to avoid seeing it in the standard issue list)
  * Create a bookmark for it so you can refer to it later on
  * If you like, create a link in the 2nd column in the wiki home page under the heading "What are the team members up to?"
  * Use Github extended markdown syntax to show checkboxes (doesn't work the same way here on the wiki, which is the reason for creating and closing instead of using the wiki for this)
  * [Example](https://github.com/EmpathyApp/EmpathyApp/issues/23)
* Use [templates](../ways-of-working/templates) when working and [these docs for ways-of-working](ways-of-working)
* If you like, order [*this book*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029380.do) about building web apps with wordpress as a platform


#### What can I do right now?

* Do code reviews (it may be easier to learn when being active in the reading, and of course you might find important things that could be improved)
* See [this howto guide](../ways-of-working/howto/finding-an-issue-to-work-on.md)
