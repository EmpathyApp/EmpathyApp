DocVer: 0.0.1


Resources needed:


* Set reminder to go through documentation once every two weeks

* Ask people to give feedback on documentation
  * ask them to change it themselves if they can improve/fix

be sure to check which people are involved and who are simply observing the project
(one way to make this easier is to change the groups, so that only people making commits are in the developer group)
