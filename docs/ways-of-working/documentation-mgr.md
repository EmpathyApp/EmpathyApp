DocVer: 1.0.0



### Prerequisites

* Github write access


### Role limitation

The documentation manager is not necessarily the person *writing* the documentation, instead he/she is the person *reviewing* it (although there is nothing stopping other people reviewing the documentation as well of course, but the documentation manager always does a review as well)


### Recurring tasks

Set reminder (for example with google calendar) once or twice each week to go through the steps below

1. Reviewing changes in the documentation ([this link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4104764/git-show-list-of-files-changed-in-recent-commits-in-a-specific-directory) may be useful)
  * Maintaining a structure for the documentation files (includes being aware of names of documents and directories and also which directories different documents are placed in)
  * Checking references to files when renaming or removing by doing a global search
  * Ensuring that the text is easy to understand for the target audience (audience is normally assumed to be a developer who is new to the project)
  * Fixing spelling errors

2. The actual changes can be made by the documentation mgr if he/she wants, or by another person (depending on the situation)
