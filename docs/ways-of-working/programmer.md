#### Programming process

1. Specifying the problem
  * Writing the problem down
  * Dividing the problem into smaller steps
2. Research
  * Finding other solutions
    * Finding two or more examples doing what we are interested in. *Reading* code
    * [*Searchcode*](https://searchcode.com/)
  * Official documentation
3. Pseudocode Programming Process
  * Comments (ex: "//Drawing a box..")
  * Subcomments (ex: "..drawing a line")
  * **Code**
4. Run in debug mode
  * Print variables
  * Debugger
5. If fail: Iterate steps 2 - 4
6. Refactor
  * Rewrite into smaller methods for reusability?
  * (Iterate, go back to PPP)
7. Write comment for function/method header
8. Writing autotest
  * Repeating [3, 4, 5, 6]
9. Commit and push
  * Commit comments: What has been added/changed? Which issue?

##### Other considerations
* Psychology:
  * Don't do anything that isn't play
  * Pomodoro technique
* Coding standard:
  * Naming system:
    * Using suffix to indicate type (important for loosly typed languages)
    * Using prefix to indicate scope
  * Comments formatting:
    * Using PPP (Pseudocode programming process)


#### Wordpress

Wordpress can be seen as an application platform

* All Javascript libs need to be added with "wp_enqueue_script" + "wp_enqueue_scripts" (Important! Otherwise we may get strange errors)


#### Coding standard

TODO

WP official coding standards: http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards

Each person may choose to use the Pseudocode programming process (PPP) which results in comments that can look a bit different


#### Branching

TODO


#### Selenium testing
