### Ways to ensure quality


#### Testing

See [this file](../planning/test-strategy.md) for ways of testing



#### Coding style

We are in general using a procedural coding style (with some object oriented and functional coding here and there if fitting for the situation)


##### Variable naming

We use camel case for variable names since there's a distinction between upper and lower case letters for variables in php

There are three parts of variable names:
* Prefix: indicates the scope of the variable
* Description: the typical description of the variable
* Suffix: indicates the type of the variable

Optional: how will the variable be used? "Mod"


#### Profiling


#### Error reporting and logging


#### Code "checking"

* JS: JSLint, JSHint
* PHP: Netbeans warnings
* Github code reviews


#### Exception handling
