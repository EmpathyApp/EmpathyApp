Keeping versions up to date


Four types of software with versioning that changes in a way that affects us:
* Our own plugin
* The other WP plugins
* WP themes
* Wordpress itself

We may want to enable auto-update (can be done in Softaculous) for the three that are not our own plugin but need to make sure the this is safe from the quality perspective, things might break if we are not careful. Otherwise we can test everything in a staging area and only after the testing has been completed update the real site
