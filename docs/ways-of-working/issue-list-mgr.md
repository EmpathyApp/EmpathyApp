People are free to take issues on by themselves without asking (though some issues are better suited for some roles)


### Prerequisites

* Github access


### Role limitation

This role does not include:
* general maintenance of github
* adding, removing users from github
* adding new github issues


### Recurring tasks

Set reminder (with ex google calendar) twice each week to go through the steps below

1. Cleaning up the issue list
  * Filtering for "no milestone" (The goal is that every issue has a milestone unless there is a special/good reason)
    Features that are for the future are put in the {n+1}.0 or n.{m+1} (where the current version is n.m)
2. Following up with people
  If you are in a hurry and don't have time to write something personal you can use this instead:
  "Hi, just checking in about the issue you are working on, are you needing help or is everything under control? Kind regards, _______"
3. Assigning issues
  1. Filtering for closest milestone
  2. Finding one or two issues for each person and taking into consideration..
    * ..which [teams](https://github.com/orgs/EmpathyApp/teams) a person belongs to
      * does the person belong to the observers group? Then we normally don't assign tasks to them
    * ..what a person wants to do and is good at
    * ..issue priority
  3. Sending an email to person asking if they can take the issue
    * Important to ask them to assign the task to themselves since this will save you time (and it will not cost them anything)
  * The goals is that each person which is not in the observers team have one or two issues
