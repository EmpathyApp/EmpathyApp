### What it means to be a core team member

* github admin access: meaning in practice that they have the ability to invite other people and make other changes inside github, even more than committing new code
* being contacted by the issue list mgr once or twice per week (assuming working on tech issues, admin issues is another matter which may not be covered in github)
* meeting once a month with the other core members via hangouts (like Mica has suggested)


### Becoming a core team member

* asking what they value about empathy, why they are interested in the project
* connecting in the beginning with the volunteer coordinator over voice call (to get to know the person better)
* connecting in the beginning with Peijman and/or Mica over voice call (to get to know the person better)
