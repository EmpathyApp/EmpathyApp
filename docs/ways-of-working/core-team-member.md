### What it means to be a core team member

* Github admin access: meaning in practice that they have the ability to invite other people and make other changes inside Github, even more than committing new code
* Being contacted by the issue list mgr once or twice per week (assuming working on tech issues, admin issues is another matter which may not be covered in Github)
* Meeting once a month with the other core members via hangouts (like Mica has suggested)


### Becoming a core team member

* Asking what they value about empathy, why they are interested in the project
* Connecting in the beginning with the volunteer coordinator over voice call (to get to know the person better)
* Connecting in the beginning with Peijman and/or Mica over voice call (to get to know the person better)
