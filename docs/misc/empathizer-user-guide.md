### Setup

1. Download skype
  1. If you have windows 8: Choose the "desktop app" version and not the "metro" version (otherwise your status will not be shown to the callers)
2. Create a skype account (don't use an ms account)
  1. Set the user name to empathizer_firstname, for example: empathier_tord
  2. Give an email address that you check often and that will not change
3. Go into skype options, then privacy and choose "allow my status to be shown on the web"


### Using skype

#### Checking in and out
* Checking in: Start skype and log on to your empathizer_firstname account
  * Only be logged in on one unit at a time (for example don't use skype with the empathizer account on both your desktop computer and your smartphone at the same time)
  * As long as you are logged in and your status is "online" or "away" people may call
* Checking out: Log out from your empathizer skype account

#### Taking a call
* When you see a user calling, change the status to "do not disturb", this will make it so that other empathizers can take calls
* After the call: Collect call info (skype name and the call length in minutes) and enter these into the form you can find on the page called "Email form"

#### More

##### Letting another empathizer get before you in the call queue
* Set the skype status to "away"

##### Taking a break
* Set skype status to "do not disturb"
* Set status (for example) "online" when you get back
