### How to report bugs

Please use [this template](../ways-of-working/templates/bug-report.md)


### Descicion process

Idea comes from the social enterprise "Empathy App" (not only the name of the app but also the name of the company). Overall design is determined by the people at Empathy App (with a so-called "benevolent dictatorship" structure). Later on we may change into concensus-based / democratic but the software requirements specification will still be determined by the Empathy App company. Of couse since there is forkability (people are free to create their own project based on Empathy App) there is still much freedom

People:
* Peijman and Mica works at Empathy App
* Tord is volunteer coordinator and himself a volunteer
* Empathizers, trained in emapathy

Money:
* Volunteers are unpaid
* empathizers will get paid as well as of course Peijman and Mica


### Volunteer responsibility

No responsibility for any financial or other damage


#### *How* development is done

The issue manager asks someone who doesn't have an issue to take one

Or people simply take issues themselves using [this guide](howto/finding-an-issue-to-work-on.md)

[This directory](../ways-of-working) contains ways of working for programmers and others


### Open conversation policy

If conversations are not obviously private we can share them with other team members. The reason for this policy is so that it does not take too long to relay information to others (otherwise the person who wants to relay information would need to wait for an email response from the person she has been in conversation with)
