The idea for Empathy App comes from Peijman and Mica at the company with the same name as the app. The company is a social enterprise which means that they have a goal not just to make money but also creating a social good


### Forums for interactions with other developers

* slack - used for most of our communication, the "default choice" for communicating in the group. slack is also used by non-tech people involved in the project
* google groups - used for formal communication that needs to be logged for the future
* skype - for calls
* github - we use github for code reviews and commenting on issues


### How to report bugs

Please use [this template](../ways-of-working/templates/bug-report.md)


### Descicion process

* Overall design and architecture is determined by the people at Empathy App (Peijman and Mica) and Tord. We are using a so-called "benevolent dictatorship" structure
* We want discussions to be very open in the project and converstions which have started as private can be made public without asking the participants (unless of course the converstion has been of a very personal nature)

People:
* Peijman and Mica works at Empathy App
* Tord is volunteer coordinator and himself a volunteer
* Empathizers, trained in emapathy
* Empathy trainers

Money:
* Volunteers are unpaid
* Empathizers will get paid as well as of course Peijman and Mica


### Volunteer responsibility

No responsibility for any financial or other damage


### License

Empathy App is free and open source software. The license used is GPLv3


#### How development is done

* The issue manager asks someone who doesn't have an issue to take one
* Or people simply take issues themselves using [this guide](howto/finding-an-issue-to-work-on.md)
* [This directory](../ways-of-working) contains ways of working for programmers and others


### Open conversation policy

If conversations are not obviously private we can share them with other team members. The reason for this policy is so that it does not take too long to relay information to others (otherwise the person who wants to relay information would need to wait for an email response from the person she has been in conversation with)
