Please note:
* The steps below describe the installation process *for the plugin but not the whole setup process* (which includes creating pages and adding shortcodes etc), for setup please see [this document](setting-up-a-new-site.md)
* For developers the standard way of updating is to use an FTP connection and upload the files directly this way

1. Download [the latest version](https://github.com/EmpathyApp/EmpathyApp/archive/master.zip) directly
  * (Alternatively: You can find the same file by going to the [code section](https://github.com/EmpathyApp/EmpathyApp) on github and clicking the button "Download ZIP")
2. Log in as admin on your wp site
3. *If upgrading:* Go to Plugins -> All plugins
  1. Deactivate the Empathy App plugin
  2. Delete the plugin
4. Go to Plugins -> Add new -> Upload plugin -> Browse
5. Find the file you downloaded in the first step above and upload this file
6. When the install process is complete choose "Activate the plugin"
